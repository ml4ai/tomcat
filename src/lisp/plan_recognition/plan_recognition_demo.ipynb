    "# Plan Recognition Demo\n",
    "## By Loren Champlin\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a demo of my plan recognition prototype algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we assume that there is an agent who is trying to complete some objective (e.g, Search and Rescue) and that they are following a plan (i.e list of grounded actions) that accomplishes this objective. This plan is generated by some type of planner (e.g, Hierarchical Task Network), one that we engineered. We also assume that there are a number of different strategies the agent can adopt to complete their objective. These different strategies are represented as top-level tasks in the planner. Given that we observe the sequence of actions an agent is taking as well as the sequence of states that procedes each action (i.e, state, action pairs), the goal of our algorithm is to infer what top-level task was used to generate the agent's plan and thus infer what strategy they are using to complete their objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is implemented using a bayesian model. Let $S$ be a categorical random variable representing the possible strategies/top-level tasks and let $O_t = (s_0,a_0), (s_1,a_1), ... , (s_t, a_t)$ where $s_i$ and $a_i$ is the state and action at time $t$. Note that $s_i$ actually happens before $a_i$ (i.e, it is the state that precedes the action), but for simplicity we will assume we observe them at the same time. With these variables defined we can use Baye's Rule to compute,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(S | O_t) = \\frac{P(O_t | S) P(S)}{P(O_t)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $P(O_t)$ is just $\\sum{S}P(O_t | S) P(S)$, in other words we can compute $P(O_t | S) P(S)$ for each value of S and then just normalize the resulting probabilities to add up to 1 by dividing each one by $\\sum{S}P(O_t | S) P(S)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only challenge in this equation is computing the likelihood $P(O_t | S)$. However we can estimate the likelihood by assuming that our planner is complete (i.e, it can simulate the distribution of all possible plans the agent can execute). Therefore we can generate plans for each value of $S$ and see if $O_t$ matches any of the plan traces (i.e, plans with both states and actions, just like our observations) up to time $t$. This matching process allows us to compute, \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(O_t | S) \\approx \\frac{\\text{number of plans from $S$ that match $O_t$}}{\\text{total number of plans from $S$}}$ "

    "# Issues to address\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main issues to address with this prototype algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first issue is that the algorithm assume that the state of the domain is fully observable. For example, in the SAR missions we don't know where the victims are before hand. Therefore under a deterministic planner, we would not be able to generate actual plans. \n",
    "\n",
    "One fix is to have uncertainty in the planner (e.g, probablistic effects). In the case where there is uncertainty in the planner (i.e, the same initial state and top-level task can produce different plans), then we merely need to generate plans for each initial state and top-level task combo multiple times until we get a large sampling of the most likely plans. I suspect that this would cause only minor errors when estimating the likelihood of the bayesian model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively the planner could be deterministic and we could instead sample initial states (and assume those are fully observable states). In other words for a domain like the SAR mission, we would sample where the victims might be. To get a decent likelihood estimate in either case, we would need to somewhat accurately estimate certain distributions such as the initial state in the alternative case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another fix for this issue is to generate a plan based off of a reduce but fully observable state reflecting the current state of for example the SAR mission. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second issue is that algorithm assumes an infallible execution of a plan generated by the corresponding planner. What this means in terms of the SAR mission is that the agent will never diverge from the strategy they using and will use the strategy perfectly. So if for example the player in the SAR mission has adopted the yellow-first strategy and for some reason they make just one action not charactistic of that strategy (e.g, triage a green victim in the dark bathroom before 5 minutes is up), then the plan recognition algorithm will rule out that strategy even if the player continues to follow that strategy for the rest of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "One fix to this strategy is to have a moving window when doing the observation/plan matching. So instead of always matching the observations to possible plans from time 0, match them starting at some time i that increase with each new observation. This way a slight divergence from a strategy will only confuse our algorithm for a short time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another fix is to assign a similarity measure between state, action pair sequences where a similarity of 1 means that the sequences are identical and a similarity of 0 means that they have nothing in common. Then we could estimate the bayesian model's likelihood by summing the similarity measures of each plan to the observed sequence. In other words,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(O_t | S) \\approx \\frac{\\text{sum of similarity measures between plans from $S$ and $O_t$}}{\\text{total number of plans from $S$}}$\n",
    "\n",
