Uses: SHOP3, SBCL, ASDF and Quicklisp.

Purpose: These simple domains and problems enable the crafting of wooden and stone tools within the Minecraft Realm. The domain
      will eventually include the crafting of iron tools, and wooden, stone, and iron weapons. 
      The purpose is to eventually run them through plan recognition algorithms.

Files that begin with "craft-*.lisp" will run through SHOP3. They contain the domain and problem definition.

Files that begin with "domain*" are written in PDDL, may not necessarily run through SHOP3, and describe only the domain definition. 

Files that begin with "problem*" are written in PDDL, may not necessarily run through SHOP3, and describe 
    only the problem definition. The problem definition mentions its relevant domain.
