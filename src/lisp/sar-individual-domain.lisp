;; Grounded STRIPS-style domains are unsupported within SHOP3.
;; SHOP3 very-loosely parses PDDL domains so as to incorporate PDDL constructs
;; but does not strictly conform to PDDL-syntax.

;; Our Domain Definitions will use SHOP3 Syntax, which provides a preliminary
;; capability to incorporate PDDL domain definitions into a SHOP3 domain.
;; PDDL-domains corresponds to the ADL PDDL-type, and it uses conditional-effects,
;; existential preconditions, universal preconditions.

;; SHOP3 domains contain Operators, Methods, and Axioms, and type:pddl-domain
;; provides support for actions typing, equality, disjunctions, quantifiers,
;; and conditional-effects
