SAR PDDL Domains/Lisp files
===========================

This folder contains all files pertaining to our Search and Rescue planning domains. The main files 
required for running the domains and problem definitions are in Common Lisp (using the .lisp extension).
There are also other minor files serving as data and utility files as well
python code for data manipulation and experiments related to plan recognition and prediction.
