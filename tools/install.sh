# cannot simply declare TRAVIS and then test if it is NULL, as cmake checks
# whether TRAVIS is set. If we had confidence that tcsh was installed, then we
# could use tcsh to check if the variable was bound, but this is an install
# script that is supposed to install things we might need, counting on as little
# as possible.
