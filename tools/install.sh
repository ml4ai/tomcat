# We cannot use '-u' because we need to be able to test if GITHUB_ACTIONS is set. We
# cannot simply declare GITHUB_ACTIONS and then test if it is NULL, as cmake checks
# whether GITHUB_ACTIONS is set. If we had confidence that tcsh was installed, then we
# could use tcsh to check if the variable was bound, but this is an install
# script that is supposed to install things we might need, counting on as little
# as possible.

# Set the TOMCAT environment variable, assuming that the directory structure
# mirrors that of the git repository.
