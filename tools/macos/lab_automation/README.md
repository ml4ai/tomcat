### Compile the libraries
There are a couple of libraries that need to be compiled before the scripts can be run. To do this manually, you can run:
```sh
scripts/compile_libraries
```
Additionally, if you use the run_pipeline script, this step will be done automatically

### Run the scripts
There are two methods you can use to run the Lab Automation Scripts:
1. Use run_pipeline to run all the scripts at once
   ```sh
	scripts/run_pipeline
   ```
2. Run the scripts individually
   ```sh
	./SCRIPT_NAME
    ```
