Lab session overview: What to do when?
======================================

You are running your first session?! Don’t panic, here’s the *big
picture* order step by step!

#. Greet participants, consent, explain what we will be doing
#. **Ask if they need to use the restroom**
#. Put on Heart Rate Electrodes (while standing)
#. Seat participant at their iMac
#. Wipe their forehead with baby shampoo
#. Attach skin conductance sensors (on shoulder blade)
#. Put cap on (see :doc:`equipment-setup`)
  * Calibrate fNIRS first
  * Then complete EEG setup
  * **If you end up doing EEG first, you can no longer move the cap during the fNIRS procedure**
#.  Put eyetracker on (see :doc:`Eyetracking`)
  * Eyetracker can only be put on after cap setup is completed
#. Give participant headset
  *  adjust microphone and/or headband
#. Wait for all participants to be ready, then start baseline tasks
