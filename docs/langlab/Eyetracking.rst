3. Open Pupil Capture App on iMAC (circle on desktop)
  * you should see three windows, two eyes and a video of the screen

4. Adjust the cameras to capture the eyes, use extenders if needed
5. Calibrate eyetracker using the big “C” button on the left of the big window
  * make sure the center camera is capturing the entire iMAC screen
6. Start recording with big “R” button on the left of the big window
