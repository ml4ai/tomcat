Equipment setup
===============

This is a general setup guide. For troubleshooting, check here:
:doc:`Troubleshooting`

Measuring head size
-------------------

Measure head by pulling tape around circumference of head, widest part of head
– above eyebrows & parallel to the ground – most women: 56cm; most men: 58cm

* Most frequent sizes: 54, 56, 58, 60
* Available sizes: 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62

*Finding a cap’s size: last two digits on top row of cap label specify
the size* |measuring the headsize|

Setup of the cap (holds EEG/fNIRS)
----------------------------------

|Cap setup|

1. Put cap on Styrofoam head, and separate out electrodes

   * Lower numbers will be on the left (1-16), higher numbers on the right (17-32)
   * Slide electrodes in holders & match up numbers
   * Make sure cables run downwards-backwards
   * Put Velcro ties on both sides when done (1-16 in one bundle, 17-32 in the second)

2. Take out optodes and push them into correct color numbers

   * Red = sources, blue = detectors, doesn’t matter which ones you start with
   * Easier if you stand up, can also put fingers under cap to help
   * White optode holder = "phantom head"
   * Accelerometer on left, D8 on right of Cz)

3. Put in ground electrode (black holder) |completed cap|

**You have completed the cap setup!** Now, the cap needs to be placed on the participant’s head.

.. _putting cap on participant:

Putting cap on participant
--------------------------

1. Have participants take off earrings & glasses, wipe forehead & front
   of ears with baby shampoo
2. Hold cap from front – back (person 1) and left-right (person 2), make
   sure front of cap is close to eyebrows

   *  Look at participant - cap should be symmetrical

3. Put green Velcro holders on optode bundles & attach to participant’s
   shirt, attach electrode splitter box to shirt

   *  May need to place on the side where the amp/port are)

4. Hook up ground and electrode cable to amplifier (gray box, don’t
   forget battery)

   *  Connect HR and skin conductance electrodes |hook up|

5. Hook up optodes to the port (smaller, white box)
6. Open Aurora (rainbow brain) app on IMAC

   *  Tomcat_aug
   *  Hit triangle/play symbol for calibration
   *  Try to get all signal to be green by shimmying, massaging the
      optodes on cap, or applying the clear ultrasound gel
   *  When done, hit the line plot symbol, then the circle to start
      recording |calibration|


Find PID for Aurora and grant it priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* When Aurora is running, open activity monitor app and find Aurora, note down PID (e.g. 1228)
* Open blank terminal (right click) and type: ``sudo renice -10 [PID]`` *e.g.: sudo renice -10 1228*


7. Measure cap position to make sure it is centered

  * Measure from ear to ear, take half of the distance = green 24 should be there
  * Measure from nasion (between eyebrows) to inion (bump at back of
    head) and Cz (green 24) should be at middle point

8. Start BrainVision Recorder on desktop PC , hit lightbulb symbol for
   lights, eye for traces |brain vision|
9. Put tips on syringes & start putting gel in opening of electrodes –
   try to aim down and under electrode, then wiggle in circles until it
   turns green
  * Optional: open photobooth app so participant can see
  * Normal for colors of electrode lights to change as you move


.. _skin conductance and hr:

Skin Conductance (GSR) & Heart Rate (ECG)
-----------------------------------------

*Make sure battery is connected to EEG-Amp. Turn on PC, open Brain
Vision Recorder app*

Skin Conductance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Grab two white wires, add a good amount of white gel to the center.

2. Attach tape to sensors and attach to participant’s scapula (shoulder blade) leaving about two fingers' distance between sensors.

   - Make sure wires face up and go over shoulder.

3. Attach wires to box with two holes

   - double-click GSR in Brain Vision software in trace mode (eye-symbol)
   - zoom in if needed

Heart Rate
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Grab black wire (ground) and two colored wires

2. use double-sided circles (stickers), remove only white backing

   - put electrode with thinner side on the sticky end

3. Attach on participant

   - black wire: under left collarbone with wire facing up and over the shoulder
   - colored wires:

     - one under the right collarbone -> goes in MINUS
     - the second one below ground under chest (left side) -> goes in PLUS

4. **FILL all three electrodes with ABRALYT gel (grey, grainy gel)**

   - cover each electrode with tape to avoid staining participant’s clothes

5. Attach to box with three holes, ground in middle

   * Double-click ECG in Brain Vision software in trace mode (eye-symbol)
   * Zoom out if needed
