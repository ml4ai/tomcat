\chapter{ASR Agent}
\label{ch:asr}
\textbf{Adarsh Pyarelal, Vincent Raymond}

The ASR agent enables the publishing of real-time transcriptions of the
participants' conversations to the message bus. The inputs to the ASR agent are
audio chunks streamed via websockets, with one stream per participant. The
chunks are then sent to the Google Cloud Speech service, which then returns
real-time transcriptions.

The ASR agent then passes along the audio chunks and the transcriptions to the
SpeechAnalyzer via an internal message bus for further downstream processing
(see \autoref{ch:sentiment_analysis}).

While the transcriptions produced by the ASR agent are not perfect, they have
improved significantly compared to the initial release. The improvement can be
attributed to two factors:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We switched to the premium `video' model offered by Google, which is
        able to handle noisy audio data much better. This change is responsible
        for most of the improvement.
    \item Further improvement was achieved by providing the service with a
        domain-specific list of phrases as hints.
\end{enumerate}

The list of domain-specific phrases we used is given in \autoref{ch:vocab}
