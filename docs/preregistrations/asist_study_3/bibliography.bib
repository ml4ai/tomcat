Speciﬁcally, we present a technique to scale plan recognition to large domain representations using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). CCG-based planning and plan recognition (like other domain-conﬁgurable planning frameworks) require domain deﬁnitions to be either manually authored or learned from data. Prior work has demonstrated successful learning of these CCG domain deﬁnitions from data, but these representations can be very large for complex application domains. We propose a MCTS-based approach to search for explanations and predict the goal of a given sequence of observed actions. We evaluate our approach on the RTS game AI testbed microRTS. Our experimental results show our method scales better to these large, learned CCGs than previous CCG-based approaches.}, booktitle={2019 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)}, publisher={IEEE}, author={Kantharaju, Pavan and Ontanon, Santiago and Geib, Christopher W.}, year={2019}, month=8, pages={1–8} }

Deployment plans for these operations are frequently negotiated on-the-fly by teams of human planners. A human operator then translates the agreed-upon plan into machine instructions for the robots. We present an algorithm that reduces this translation burden by inferring the final plan from a processed form of the human team’s planning conversation. Our hybrid approach combines probabilistic generative modeling with logical plan validation used to compute a highly structured prior over possible plans, enabling us to overcome the challenge of performing inference over a large solution space with only a small amount of noisy data from the team planning session. We validate the algorithm through human subject experimentations and show that it is able to infer a human team’s final plan with 86\% accuracy on average. We also describe a robot demonstration in which two people plan and execute a first-response collaborative task with a PR2 robot. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate a logical planning technique within a generative model to perform plan inference.}, journal={Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research}, author={Kim, Been and Chacha, Caleb M. and Shah, Julie A.}, year={2015}, month=3, pages={361–398} }

     abstractNote={Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex, dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter di ering, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in ful lling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly exible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply tting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their in exibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their domain-speci city hinders reusability.},

 @inproceedings{Ramirez_Geffner_2009, place={Pasadena}, title={Plan Recognition as Planning}, abstractNote={In this work we aim to narrow the gap between plan recognition and planning by exploiting the power and generality of recent planning algorithms for recognizing the set G∗ of goals G that explain a sequence of observations given a domain theory. After providing a crisp deﬁnition of this set, we show by means of a suitable problem transformation that a goal G belongs to G∗ if there is an action sequence π that is an optimal plan for both the goal G and the goal G extended with extra goals representing the observations. Exploiting this result, we show how the set G∗ can be computed exactly and approximately by minor modiﬁcations of existing optimal and suboptimal planning algorithms, and existing polynomial heuristics. Experiments over several domains show that the suboptimal planning algorithms and the polynomial heuristics provide good approximations of the optimal goal set G∗ while scaling up as well as state-of-the-art planning algorithms and heuristics.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the Twenty-First International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, publisher={IJCAI Organization}, author={Ramirez, Miquel and Geffner, Hector}, year={2009}, pages={6} }

Indeed, we humans are constantly understanding and predicting the actions and goals of others, which allows us to interact in intuitive and safe ways. While action and plan recognition are tasks that humans perform naturally and with little effort, they are still an unresolved problem from the point of view of artiﬁcial intelligence. The immense variety of possible actions and plans that may be encountered in an unconstrained environment makes current approaches be far from human-like performance. In addition, while very different types of algorithms have been proposed to tackle the problem of activity, plan, and goal (intention) recognition, these tend to focus in only one part of the problem (e.g., action recognition), and techniques that address the problem as a whole have been not so thoroughly explored. This review is meant to provide a general view of the problem of activity, plan, and goal recognition as a whole. It presents a description of the problem, both from the human perspective and from the computational perspective, and proposes a classiﬁcation of the main types of approaches that have been proposed to address it (logic-based, classical machine learning, deep learning, and brain-inspired), together with a description and comparison of the classes. This general view of the problem can help on the identiﬁcation of research gaps, and may also provide inspiration for the development of new approaches that address the problem in a uniﬁed way.}, journal={Frontiers in Robotics and AI}, author={Van-Horenbeke, Franz A. and Peer, Angelika}, year={2021}, month=5, pages={643010} }
