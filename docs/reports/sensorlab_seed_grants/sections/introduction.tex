\chapter{Introduction}

In this report we describe the activities performed and milestones met for the
following SensorLab seed grants:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Automated real-time detection of closed-loop communication in spoken
        dialogue.
    \item Development of an open-source dashboard for team communication
        experiments.
