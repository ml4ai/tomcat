\section{Raw data}

In what follows, strings enclosed by a pair of angle brackets (\verb|<>|) indicate
placeholders for more specific strings (i.e., variables).
We break the directory structure for raw ToMCAT data into three parts
\verb|<root>/<study>/<raw_data>|.
As an experiment is run, data is written to the LangLab Linux computer called
``cat''. \verb|<root>| on cat is
\verb|/data/cat|. The data gets mirrored onto the LangLab Linux computer called
``tom'', where \verb|<root>| is \verb|/data/tom|.
This is done by the script \verb|sync_tom_and_cat|, which is called by the script
\verb|pull_tomcat_data|. Ideally, \verb|sync_tom_and_cat| should also be
called from the main driver script as soon as the experiment is over, but
currently we do not do this.

The script \verb|pull_tomcat_data| transfers the data to the IVILAB machine
\textit{i03.cs.arizona.edu}, and makes two backups of it.  Ideally, we would
also create off-site backups, but we do not do this yet. The data is is
written to
\verb|/tomcat_raw_<N>| where \verb|<N>| is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and backed up to
\verb|/tomcat_raw_<N>_B1| and \verb|/tomcat_raw_<N>_B2|.
The script \verb|pull_tomcat_data| then makes links to those multiple data
locations from \verb|/tomcat/data/raw| and provides access via NFS to the compute
servers \textit{laplace.cs.arizona.edu} and \textit{gauss.cs.arizona.edu}.
Thus, on those IVILAB machines, \verb|<ROOT>| is \verb|/tomcat/data/raw|.
The directory structure pattern for \verb|<study>| under the root directory is

\begin{verbatim}
<facility>/experiments/<study>
\end{verbatim}

For this experiment, \verb|<facility>| is \textit{LangLab}, and \verb|<study>|
is \verb|study_3_pilot|.  This study name is a bit misleading, but makes senses
as this study gradually morphed from an initial pilot study to a real one as we
developed the system, but most data is informative.

\verb|<raw_data>| has two subdirectories, ``presession'' and ``group'', containing data
from the presession experiments and main experiments separately. In both cases, we put the
data from one experimental instance into a directory named
\verb|exp_<yyyy>_<mm>_<dd>_<hh>|. Since we only run one main session at a time, and
they last from most of an hour to over three hours, hourly time resolution
suffices to disambiguate them. However, presessions take only 15 to 30 minutes,
and so a presession directory can hold data for multiple participants.

The group session runs are post processed so that all presession data for the
participants in the group are linked from the group data directory. This
matching cannot be done before the group experiment is finished because we do
not know in advance whether there will be no-shows or other last minute
changes.

To further clarify directory naming, on the IVILAB compute servers,
the data for the first valid group session is in:
%
\begin{verbatim}
/tomcat/data/raw/LangLab/experiments/study_3_pilot/group/exp_2022_09_30_10
\end{verbatim}
However, this might be reported  differently because of the linking described
above. Specifically, the previous example is equivalent to:
%
\begin{verbatim}
/tomcat_raw_1/data/LangLab/experiments/study_3_pilot/group/exp_2022_09_30_10
\end{verbatim}
%
In the original data there are some group experiment directories with time
strings earlier than the above example, but those are all preliminary pilot
experiments. We keep the raw data regardless, but all directories with serious
issues are filtered out when we create derived data sets for general
consumption.

\subsection{Raw data structure for group sessions}

As mentioned above, a post-processing step links all needed presession files into
the group experimental runs. We describe the final group session data with
needed presession data included.

%\kobus{Chinmai used <> for variables, except also YYYY, MM, etc. I am not sure
%whether we should try to make it all consistent.}
% Adarsh (2023-07-18): I changed all the variable instances to use <>.

Each of the three participants are associated by the name of the iMac device
they use during the experiment.
The iMac devices are named as lion, tiger, and
leopard. We define
<cat> $\in \{leopard, lion, tiger\}$
and <Cat> $\in \{Leopard, Lion, Tiger\}$,
and use <cat> or <Cat> to represent the three instances.

%\kobus{Some of this is from a very old document. And the rest is from me quickly looking
%at both early and recent data directories. Please check and update!! And include
%details!!!}

\kobus{Also, I understand we changed formats mid stream. We need to specify
these differences here.}

Prior to April 2023, we recorded physio data for each station to a separate
XDF file, and the rest of the data (baseline task observations, Minecraft data,
etc.) to separate files. However, we realized that timestamps were not
synchronized across different XDF files. Furthermore, recording the non-physio
data to separate files made it difficult to synchronize timestamps between
physio and non-physio data. To overcome these limitations, starting in April
2023, we made a substantial change to the recording setup such that all data
was now streamed through LSL and only a single XDF file would be written to at
a time. The only data we excluded from the XDF files was the raw face and screen
capture images---however, we did push the timestamps (corresponding to when the
images were captured) onto LSL, resulting in them being written to the XDF file
as well.

We call the pre-April 2023 setup \emph{v1}, and the subsequent setup \emph{v2}.
For redundancy, we retain the existing mechanisms from v1 that were
recording to non-XDF files---thus, there is some overlap in the directory
structure for the v1 and v2 recording outputs. However, with the exception of
images, the XDF files supersede the non-XDF files for the v2 recording setup.
In the directory structure shown below, we denote which directories are only
present in v1 or v2 data using comments starting with an octothorpe (\verb|#|).

Underneath each experiment (\verb|<raw_data>|) directory (i.e.,\\
\verb|<root>/<study>/group/exp_<yyyy>_<mm>_<dd>_<hh>|), we have the following
file/directory structure:
