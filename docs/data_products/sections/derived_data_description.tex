\section{Derived Data Description}

\subsection{Derived Data Files}

The following folders contain several versions of derived data at various synchronization frequencies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{fnirs\_10hz} contains synchronized fNIRS signals and task data at 10 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{fnirs\_500hz} contains synchronized fNIRS signals and task data at 500 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{eeg\_500hz} contains synchronized EEG signals and task data at 500 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{ekg\_500hz} contains synchronized EKG signals and task data at 500 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{gsr\_500hz} contains synchronized GSR signals and task data at 500 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{fnirs\_eeg\_ekg\_gsr\_120hz} contains synchronized fNIRS, EEG, EKG, and GSR signals and task data at 120 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{fnirs\_eeg\_ekg\_gsr\_1200hz} contains synchronized fNIRS, EEG, EKG, and GSR signals and task data at 1200 Hz sampling rate.
\end{itemize}

Each derived data folder contains synchronized fNIRS, EEG, EKG, and/or GSR signals for each task and for the entire experiment for each experiment:
\begin{verbatim}
exp_*/
    all.csv
    rest_state.csv
    finger_tapping.csv
    affective_individual_lion.csv
    affective_individual_tiger.csv
    affective_individual_leopard.csv

    ping_pong_competitive_lion_tiger.csv
    ping_pong_competitive_leopard_cheetah.csv
    ping_pong_cooperative.csv
    minecraft_saturn_a.csv
    minecraft_saturn_b.csv
\end{verbatim}

Each experiment contains the following CSV files, with columns described in \ref{sec:derived_data_cols_desc}:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{all.csv} contains the synchronized signal of all participants for the entire recording sessions, including signals and data in all tasks.
  \item \texttt{rest\_state.csv} contains the synchronized signal and rest state task data.
  \item \texttt{finger\_tapping.csv} contains the synchronized signal and finger tapping task data.
  \item \texttt{affective\_individual\_lion.csv} contains the synchronized signal and individual affective task data for participant using the Lion computer in the lab.
  \item \texttt{affective\_individual\_tiger.csv} contains the synchronized signal and individual affective task data for participant using the Leopard computer in the lab.
  \item \texttt{affective\_individual\_leopard.csv} contains the synchronized signal and individual affective task data for participant using the Leopard computer in the lab.
  \item \texttt{affective\_team.csv} contains the synchronized signal and team affective task data.
  \item \texttt{ping\_pong\_competitive\_lion\_tiger.csv} contains the synchronized signal and ping pong competitive task data between participants sitting on Lion and Tiger stations.
  \item \texttt{ping\_pong\_competitive\_leopard\_cheetah.csv} contains the synchronized signal and ping pong competitive task data between a participant sitting on Leopard station and an experimenter sitting on the Cheetah station.
  \item \texttt{ping\_pong\_cooperative.csv} contains the synchronized signal and ping pong cooperative task data between three participants against an artificial intelligent agent.
  \item \texttt{minecraft\_hands\_on\_training.csv} contains the synchronized signal and Minecraft search-and-rescue hands-on training mission data.
  \item \texttt{minecraft\_saturn\_a.csv} contains the synchronized signal and Minecraft search-and-rescue Saturn A mission data.
  \item \texttt{minecraft\_saturn\_b.csv} contains the synchronized signal and Minecraft search-and-rescue Saturn B mission data.
\end{itemize}

Not all experiments may include the aforementioned CSV files, due to a couple
of primary reasons. Firstly, time constraints can result in certain tasks
remaining incomplete in some experiments. Secondly, instances where the
experiment involves only two participants or the recorded signals are
compromised during certain tasks can also lead to the absence of these CSV
files.
