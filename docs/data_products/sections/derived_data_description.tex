\section{Derived Data Description}

\subsection{Derived Data Files}

The following folders contain several versions of derived data at various synchronization frequencies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{fnirs\_20hz} contains synchronized fNIRS signals and task data at 20 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{fnirs\_raw\_20hz} contains synchronized fNIRS raw signals and task data at 20 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{eeg\_1000hz} contains synchronized EEG signals and task data at 1000 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{eeg\_1200hz\_120hz} contains synchronized EEG signals with 1200 Hz sampling rate, then downsampled to 120 Hz sampling rate and synchronized and task data.
  \item \texttt{fnirs\_eeg\_1000hz} contains synchronized fNIRS and EEG signals and task data at 1000 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{fnirs\_raw\_eeg\_1000hz} contains synchronized fNIRS raw and EEG signals and task data at 1000 Hz sampling rate.
  \item \texttt{fnirs\_eeg\_1200hz\_120hz} contains synchronized fNIRS and EEG signals with 1200 Hz sampling rate, then downsampled to 120 Hz sampling rate and synchronized and task data.

\end{itemize}

Each derived data folder contains synchronized fNIRS and/or EEG signals for each task and for the entire experiment for each experiment:

\end{itemize}

Not all experiments may include the aforementioned CSV files, due to a couple
of primary reasons. Firstly, time constraints can result in certain tasks
remaining incomplete in some experiments. Secondly, instances where the
experiment involves only two participants or the recorded signals are
compromised during certain tasks can also lead to the absence of these CSV
files.
