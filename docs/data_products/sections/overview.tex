\section{Overview}

The experiment involves a three person team participating in one or two
search and rescue (SAR) missions simulated in the Minecraft environment.
Before participants execute this experiment, they individually attend a
`pre-session' where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item They fill consent forms,
    \item We measure their head circumference to enable setting up brain data
        caps before they arrive at the main session,
    \item We ask them to perform a speech elicitation task
\end{itemize}
%
The group session typically occurs a few days to few weeks later.
The group session has multiple phases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rest state task
    \item Finger tapping task
    \item Affective task
    \item Ping pong competitive task
    \item Ping pong cooperative task
    \item Hands-on Minecraft training
    \item Saturn A mission
    \item Saturn B mission
\end{itemize}

The number of Saturn B missions in the data is fewer than the number of Saturn
A missions, since frequently there were unexpected technical issues or delays
during the group session such that we ran out of time before the Saturn B
mission could be run.

During all these phases, for each participant, we record the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item EKG
    \item EEG
    \item fNIRS
    \item Eye tracking data
    \item Testbed messages
    \item Audio of participants' spoken dialog
    \item Facial video
    \item Screen captures
\end{itemize}
