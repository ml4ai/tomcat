\section{Overview}

The main experiment involves a three person team participating in one or two
search and rescue (SAR) missions simulated in the Minecraft environment. 
Before participants execute this experiment, they individually attend a
presession where 1) they fill consent forms; 2) we measure their head circumference to enable setting up brain data caps
before they arrive at the main session; 3) we ask them to do XXX to calibrate
their speech; 4) XXX. The main session typically occurs a few days to few weeks
later. 

The main experiment collects data from multiple phases, consisting of a training
session lasting for XXX minutes, three baseline activities, and one or two SAR
missions, depending on whether the experiment has gone well enough that there is
time for a second SAR mission.  The first baseline activities is XXX. The second
baseline is XXX.  The third baseline is XXX.  During all these phases, for each
participant, we collect a variety of physiological measures including EKG, EEG,
and fNIRS, Minecraft game data, audio recordings, eye tracking data, face data,
and images of what is on their screen.
