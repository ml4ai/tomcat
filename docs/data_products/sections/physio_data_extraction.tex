\section{Physiological data extraction}
The ToMCAT dataset incorporates various types of physiological data, including EEG, fNIRS, EKG, GSR, and Gaze, all of which are stored in .xdf files. For the sake of convenience and readability, these files should be transformed into a more accessible format, such as CSV. This transformation can be accomplished using a Python script located at  \code{tomcat/human_experiments/lab_software/data_extraction/tomcat-physio-data-extraction/run_physio_data_extraction.py}. This script takes the experiment directory as input and works harmoniously with both the old and new data pipelines.

For the old data pipeline, the required file structure is as outlined below:
\begin{verbatim}
    exp_*/
     lion/eeg_fnirs_pupil/lion_eeg_fnirs_pupil.xdf
     tiger/eeg_fnirs_pupil/tiger_eeg_fnirs_pupil.xdf
     leopard/eeg_fnirs_pupil/leopard_eeg_fnirs_pupil.xdf
\end{verbatim}

Conversely, the new data pipeline requires this file structure:
\begin{verbatim}
    exp_*/lsl/
      block_1.xdf
      block_2.xdf
\end{verbatim}

The script produces output files for both the old and new data pipelines, following this organization:
\begin{verbatim}
    exp_*/
     lion/
          EEG.csv
          Gaze.csv
          NIRS.csv
          NIRS_raw.csv
     tiger/
          EEG.csv
          Gaze.csv
          NIRS.csv
          NIRS_raw.csv
     leopard/
          EEG.csv
          Gaze.csv
          NIRS.csv
          NIRS_raw.csv

\end{verbatim}
In the case of the new data pipeline, an additional folder is created with the following structure:
\begin{verbatim}
    exp_*/
     baseline_tasks/
          affective/
               individual_<cat>_<participantID>_<timestamp>.csv
               individual_<cat>_<participantID>_<timestamp>_metadata.json
               team_<timestamp>.csv
               team_<timestamp>_metadata.json
          finger_tapping/
               <timestamp>.csv
               <timestamp>_metadata.json
          ping_pong/
               competitive_0_<timestamp>.csv
               competitive_1_<timestamp>.csv
               cooperative_0_<timestamp>.csv
          rest_state/
               <timestamp>.csv

\end{verbatim}

However, in case any of these files do not exist due to unexpected circumstances, the script will still proceed to extract the remaining available data.
