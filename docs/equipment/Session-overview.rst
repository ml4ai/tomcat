You are running your first session?! Don’t panic, here’s the *big
picture* order step by step!

1.  Greet participants, consent, explain what we will be doing
2.  **Ask if they need to use the restroom**
3.  Put on Heart Rate Electrodes (while standing)
4.  Seat participant at their iMAC
5.  Wipe their forehead with baby shampoo
6.  Attach skin conductance sensors (on shoulder blade)
7.  `put cap
    on <https://github.com/val-pf/tomcat-equipment-wiki/wiki/equipment-setup#putting-cap-on-participant>`__

    -  calibrate fNIRS first
    -  then complete EEG setup
    -  **if you end up doing EEG first, you can no longer move the cap
       during the fNIRS procedure**

8.  `put eyetracker
    on <https://github.com/val-pf/tomcat-equipment-wiki/wiki/eyetracking>`__

    -  eyetracker can only be put on after cap setup is completed

9.  Give participant headset

    -  adjust microphone and/or headband

10. Wait for all participants to be ready, then start baseline tasks
