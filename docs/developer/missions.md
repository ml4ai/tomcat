Guide to developing ToMCAT missions
===================================

ToMCAT aims to provide a flexible framework for studying human-machine teaming
in the virtual world of Minecraft. It provides an API for constructing various
scenarios in Minecraft that can act as focused tests of specific aspects of
human-machine teaming as well as machine social intelligence. Following the
parlance of [Project Malmo](https://github.com/microsoft/malmo), the platform
we build upon, we term these scenarios as 'missions'.
