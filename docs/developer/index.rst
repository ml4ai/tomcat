Welcome to the developer documentation for ToMCAT. We collect here a miscellany
of notes as institutional knowledge to help current developers and help new
developers get up-to-speed rapidly. 

If you are a developer and you find yourself writing a lengthy email describing
how to implement a particular feature or debug a particularly ornery bug in the
ToMCAT codebase, consider adding it to the ToMCAT developer documentation so
that it can help future developers.

The API for the Java component of ToMCAT can be found here: `Java API
<java_api/index.html>`_
