Welcome to the developer documentation for ToMCAT. We collect here a miscellany
of notes as institutional knowledge to help current developers and help new
developers get up-to-speed rapidly. 

If you are a developer and you find yourself writing a lengthy email describing
how to implement a particular feature or debug a particularly ornery bug in the
ToMCAT codebase, consider adding it to the ToMCAT developer documentation so
that it can help future developers.
