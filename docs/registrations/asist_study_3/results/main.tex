    \textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}

    This document contains the results of our evaluation of a number of
    artificial social intelligence (ASI) capabilities that we hypothesized
    would be demonstrated in ASIST Study 3. We preregistered these capability
    declarations at \url{https://osf.io/hsy32}, and follow up here with results
    of our evaluations of these capabilities. We include the text of the
    preregistration, with the results appended in separate subsections, so that
    the reader does not need to spend additional time context-switching and
    cross-referencing between two documents. The preregistration section of
    \autoref{ch:question_plan} has been updated for additional clarity.
