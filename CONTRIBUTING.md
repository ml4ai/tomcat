CONTRIBUTING
============

We subscribe to the philosophy of keeping the master branch deployable. This
means that pushing directly to the master branch is (in general) disallowed,
and all changes to it will be through pull requests. Additionally, the master
branch is protected - merging will not be possible until all the continuous
integration checks pass.
