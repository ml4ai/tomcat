Run 
    Launch should be faster and integrated with running the mission

    Scripts should be in one place and robust to how they are called. 

    It is not clear how and when the env var TOMCAT is or should be used.


Game
    It is not clear that "you" are quite wide and that it is your right arm that
    you see. Getting through a tight passage might be on more thing to do in the
    tutorial mission.

    "e" key --- I assume for us. Easy to hit instead of "w". Any options as to
    how the keys work? 

    Short delay after success? 

    Success for seeing creatures is not clear. 

    What is the amphitheatre is not so clear. Gate latch also.
