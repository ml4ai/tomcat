If TOMCAT env var is not set when we do runExperiment, we get an abort. Could we
check that it is set via the getenv() system call and exit with a better error
message? 

If we kill runExperiment, then Minecraft is not useable, even though it seems
to be running. Likely more cleanup in runExperiment and/or dealing with signal
15 is needed?

If I run two missions in a row without killing Minecraft, I often (always) loose
my cursor control. I think this is whenever the mission does not exit
successfully?

Once I had the time limit set to 30s and then went wondering around in the wrong
direction, and the time limit was forgotten. I have not been able to reproduce
this.
