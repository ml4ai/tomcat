# On macOS, there is a conflict between MacPorts OpenCV compiled using the
# Command Line Tools and XCode that might be installed on the user's computer.
# We attempt to ensure a consistent compilation experience by pointing CMake to
# the Command Line Tools instead of the XCode headers. This has to be set prior
# to the first project() command (see
# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT.html for more
# details).
