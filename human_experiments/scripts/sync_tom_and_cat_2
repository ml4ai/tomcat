# Identification:
#     Support script for script sync_tom_and_cat.
#
# Description:
#     See sync_tom_and_cat.
#
# Output:
#     All output goes to stdout for sync_tom_and_cat to do with it what it will. 
#
# Exit status:
#     Following unix convention, this script exits with 0 on success, and
#     non-zero if there was an error.

# provide access to the owner and group, but not to others, mostly not to
# propagate bad practice.  But, so far (Nov 6, 2022) the generation scripts do
# not get this completely correct. So, we make things more robust by setting
# things here.

# If we need to fix the group also:
#     sudo chown -R :langlab ${sensor_data_dir}

# We should not need to use sudo, and would prefer not to, but if things are too
