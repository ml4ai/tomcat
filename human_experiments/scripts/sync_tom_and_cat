# Identification:
#     Synchronizes data between two cross mounted disks on LangLab computers
#     tom and cat. 
#
# Description:
#     This script synchronizes data between two cross mounted disks on LangLab
#     computers tom and cat. The two data stores are set at the beginning of the
#     script, and we assume they will not change very often.  In the rare case
#     that there are two files that have the same name but are different, we
#     move the older one to have a dated suffix. 
#
#     This script should be run as sudo on either cat or tom. Generally, it
#     should be called right after data collection by the master "uber" script.
#     In addition, it should be called by the scripts that pull data IVILAB
#     servers. 
#     
#     We assume that this script lives in ${HOME}/tomcat/scripts, which should
#     be symbolic link to the current code repo. Since this script should be run
#     as sudo on a linux machine, ${HOME} is generally /root. 
#
#     This script relies on the UID for tom on tom is the same as the UID for
#     cat on cat. This "feature" might be confusing, but so far it has not
#     caused grief. 
#
# Output: 
#     All output, including error output, goes to stdout, and is also appended
#     to ${HOME}/tomcat/logs/sync_tom_and_cat.log. Because of this logging, in
#     scripts, redirecting stdout to /dev/null might make sense. However, one
#     should always check the exit status.
#
# Exit status:
#     Following unix convention, this script exits with 0 on success, and
#     non-zero if there was an error.
