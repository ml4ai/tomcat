# Identification:
#     Synchronizes data between two cross mounted disks on LangLab computers
#     tom and cat. 
#
# Synopsis:
#      sync_tom_and_cat [ -q ]
#
# Description:
#     This script synchronizes data between two cross mounted disks on LangLab
#     computers tom and cat. The two data stores are set at the beginning of the
#     script, and we assume they will not change very often.  In the rare case
#     that there are two files that have the same name but are different, we
#     move the older one to have a dated suffix. 
#
#     This script should be run as either user tom on machine tom or user cat on
#     machine cat, or potentially a user on one of those two machines in the
#     group tomcat. Generally, it should be called right after data collection
#     by the master "uber" script.  In addition, it should be called by the
#     scripts that pull data IVILAB servers. 
#     
#     We assume that this script lives in ${HOME}/tomcat/scripts, which should
#     be symbolic link to the current code repo. 
#
#     This script may rely on the UID for tom on tom being the same as the UID for
#     cat on cat. This "feature" might be confusing, but so far it has not
#     caused grief. Also, being in group "tomcat" should also provide needed
#     permissions as long as the GID is shared over tom and cat. 
#
# Output: 
#     All output, including error output, goes to stdout, and is also appended
#     to ${HOME}/tomcat/logs/sync_tom_and_cat.log. Because of this logging,
#     when called from other scripts, we may not want any output. Rather than 
#     redirect to /dev/null, we can ask for no output with the first optional
#     argument '-q'. 
#
#     but  might make sense. However, one
#     should always check the exit status.
#
#     This scripts respects the setting of IVI_VERBOSE. If it is set to "1",
#     then we provide more output. 
#
# Exit status:
#     Following unix convention, this script exits with 0 on success, and
#     non-zero if there was an error.
