It contains important information about this study and what to expect if you decide to</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">participate. Please consider the information carefully. Feel free to ask questions before making your</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">decision whether or not to participate.</span></p> <p><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The purpose of this research is to develop an artificially intelligent computer agent that can help</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">human teams perform better. If you choose to participate, you will play a Minecraft game with</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">several other people, while the computer agent watches and sometimes provides advice. During the</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">game we will measure your brain activity, eye gaze, heart rate, muscle activity and sweating (and that</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">of the other players) and the computer agent may ask you questions about how you are feeling. We</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">will also videotape you while you play the game. Your participation in the study will take place during</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">four lab sessions and will require about 9.5 hours of your time. There is some risk that someone could</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">recognize you in the videotape, or that you will be upset by the game or the other players. There is no</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">direct benefit to you of participating.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>Why is this study being done?<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This research study is being done so that we can develop an artificially intelligent (AI) agent that can</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">participate in human teams to improve the teams performance. The first goal of the research is to</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">train the agent to observe the team (including video of the team, chat messages, brain activity, heart</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">rate, sweating and eye gaze) and predict from those observations what the humans are trying to do</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">in the game, how coordinated they are as a team, and how they feel about the game and about each</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">other. The second goal of the research is to train the agent to communicate with the humans and</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">take actions that could improve the teams performance.</span></p> <p><br />What will happen if I take part in this study?<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you choose to participate you will do the activities listed below during four lab sessions along with</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">several other people.</span></p> <p><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">" At the pre-session, you will be asked to answer some brief socio-demographic questions (e.g., your</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">age, ethnicity, etc.) and do a speech/language task where you will read some sentences out loud</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">and provide spoken directions for someone else to navigate from a start to an end point on a map</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">that will be given to you . You will then be asked to schedule times within the next 6-8 weeks to</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">complete the 3 testing sessions.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">" At the testing session, sensors will be placed on your torso and head that will measure heart rate,</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">muscle activity, sweating, brain activity and eye gaze. You will also wear a headset with speakers</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">and a microphone. All communication between yourself, the research assistant and other</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">participants will take place via the headset.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">" The session will be videotaped. You and the other participants may be able to see each others</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">videos during the session.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">" You will be asked to complete the following three baseline tasks on the computer individually</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">and/or as a team: finger tapping, looking at emotional pictures, and a ping-pong game.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">" After the baseline tasks you will play a game in Minecraft. You will be given a tutorial about how to</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">play the game and a chance to practice the game.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">" You and the other participants will be separated by a screen and given a chance to discuss your</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">strategy using either chat messages or conversation via the headsets.. You can also chat with the</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">other players throughout the game.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">" The Minecraft game will either involve: 1) saving villagers, who are hiding in closed rooms within a</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">building, from various creatures that appear in Minecraft (e.g., zombies, creepers, etc.), or 2) a</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">search and rescue mission where you must navigate through a building and rescue victims and</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">remove hazards. There will be a 20-minute time limit on the game. Your performance during the</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">game will be recorded.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">" Every 3 minutes, the computer agent may pause the game and ask you to answer some questions</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">about what you are thinking and feeling. The agent may also offer you some information or advice.</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The agent may be acting in a truly intelligent way, coming up with its own information and advice,</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">or it may be preprogrammed or controlled by the research assistant.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">" After the game, all sensors and the headsets will be removed. You will answer another set of</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">questions about your feelings about the game, the agent, and your teammates and the team as a</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">whole.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">" Finally, the game may be played back on the computer screen and you may be asked to pause the</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">play-back (by pushing a computer key) at any point that you remember having a plan in mind (e.g.,</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">an idea about what you were trying to do, or a plan about a sequence of actions that you intended</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">to take), or changing your plans, or feeling confused about what to do. You will be asked to tell the</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">research assistant what you remember, and the research assistant may ask clarifying questions.</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This will be audio-recorded and may be translated into text using natural language processing</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">algorithms.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>How long will I be in the study?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br />You will be done with the study after the half hour pre-session and the 3 three-hour lab sessions, all<br />of which will occur sometime in the next 6-8 weeks.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br /></span>How many people will take part in this study?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br />Approximately 900 people will take part in this study.<br /></span></p> <p> </p> <p>Can I stop being in the study?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br />Your participation is voluntary. You do not need to participate in this study. If you decide to take<br />part in the study, you may leave the study at any time. No matter what decision you make, there will<br />be no penalty to you and you will not lose any of your usual benefits. Your decision will not affect<br />your future relationship with The University of Arizona. If you are a student or employee at the<br />University of Arizona, your decision will not affect your grades or employment status.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>What risks or benefits can I expect from being in the study?<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The only risks are that you may find the game to be stressful or you may be upset by the other</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">players. There is also a minimal risk that your data, including the videotape, could be accessed by</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">someone not on the research team, although we will be very careful to keep all the data, including</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">the video secure and confidential.</span></p> <p><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">There are no benefits to you for participating, except that you may find it fun to play the game.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>Will I be paid for participating in the study or experience any costs?<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Participants will receive a $10.00 Amazon gift card for each hour of the study they complete. You will</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">attend the half hour pre-session and 3 three hour lab sessions, so you will receive a $95.00 Amazon</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">gift card at the end of the lab sessions. If you cannot, or choose not to, participate in all the sessions</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">you will still receive gift cards for the sessions you do attend..</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You also have a chance of winning an additional $20.00 Amazon gift card if your team gets the</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">highest score on the video game out of 20 lab sessions.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You also have the option of receiving research credit if you are a student participating for credit</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">through the UA SONA system in the Department of Psychology. Participants will attend the half hour</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">pre-session and 3 three-hour lab sessions, so you will receive 9.5 SONA credits at the end of the lab</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">sessions. If you cannot, or choose not to, participate in all sessions, you will still receive the SONA</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">credits for the sessions you do attend.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you receive greater than $50.00, we will be required by UA Financials to record your name and</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">social security number. This information will not be stored, however. It will be recorded as a hardcopy</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">and delivered to the Norton School Business Office as soon as the session ends, or if the</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">business office is closed it will be kept in a locked drawer in the lab, accessible only by senior research</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">staff, and then delivered the next time the business office is open.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The only costs to you for participating are your time and any transportation costs due to attending</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">the lab session(s).</span></p> <p><br />Will my study-related information be kept confidential?<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential. All the data for the study will be</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">encrypted and password protected. Most of the measures that you provide in the study will be</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">anonymous. You will be given a random ID number and your name will not be recorded anywhere.</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The audio and video recordings of the sessions are the only measures that could be used to identify</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">you. You will not be identified in any report or publication of this study. However, you could be</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">identified from the videotape of your session, but the video will not show anything sensitive. It will</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">just show your face and torso as you play the video game. If you are participating with other people,</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">it will also show their faces and torsos. In addition, if you are participating with other people, we will</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">tell all participants in the study that the comments made during the lab session should be kept</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">confidential, but it is possible that participants may repeat comments outside the group.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We will also be collecting and storing data through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). The</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">REDCap electronic data management (EDM) system at the University of Arizona is housed on 2 virtual</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">servers; one supporting database services and the other web services. In REDCap, appropriate</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">measures are in place to maintain confidentiality and security of all incoming data.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The information that you provide in the study will be handled confidentially. However, there may be</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">circumstances where this information must be released or shared as required by law. The University</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">of Arizona Institutional Review Board; other federal, state, or international regulatory agencies; or</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">the sponsor of the study, if any, may review the research records for monitoring purposes. In</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">particular, representatives of the U.S. Department of Defense will have access to research records as</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">part of their responsibilities for human subjects protection oversight of the study.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>Will my study-related information be used for future research?<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Information that may identify you, such as the videotape of the session, may be used for future</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">research without additional consent. All data from the study will be kept forever and cannot be</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">withdrawn once it has been collected.</span></p> <p><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your data will also be shared with other research teams collaborating on this study at other</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">universities and research companies. Arizona State University is organizing a secure data base that we</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">and 12 other research teams will use to share data, including the videos from this study.
