## 2023-07-17

This is a major update that implements the following changes.

## Base tables

A number of 'base tables' have been added in order to facilitate querying, as
well as provide additional layers of validation while constructing the
database. The tables that have been added are the following:

- `data_validity`: This table contains information about
                   which participants were involved in the tasks, and whether
                   the data from the EEG,
                   fNIRS, and eye tracking modalities are valid. In most
                   cases, when an experimenter stepped in to replace a
                   participant (e.g., for a now-show participant), they did
                   not wear fNIRS/EEG devices, and in some cases, they did not
                   wear the eye tracker either. Not all groups completed all
                   the tasks, and for some tasks, the data is missing. In
                   cases such as these, the table simply omits rows for which
                   we do not have data.
- `modality`: The modality of a physiological observation (currently contains
information about EEG/fNIRS/eye tracking, other modalities (e.g., EKG) to be
added soon.)
- `task`: The task being performed.
- `station`: The ID of the iMac that the participant was seated at while
performing a task. As it turns out, this information is critical for sorting
out participant IDs in cases when an experimenter steps in to take the place
of a participant, or in some cases, when participants are moved from one
station to another due to equipment issues. It is also a potentially useful
field to have for other types of queries.

### Other changes:

#### `participant`

- The `is_confederate` column has been removed from the `participant` table,
for two reasons:
  - The datatype of the `participant.id` column is now `INTEGER`.
  - The Datasette interface was displaying the value of the `is_confederate`
  column in links arising from foreign key relationships, instead of the actual
  value of the participant ID.
  - We now have additional participant IDs to denote special circumstances:
    - -1 indicates an unknown participant.
    - -2 indicates the team as a whole. This is relevant for the
    affective_task_event table, where some events intrinsically involve the
    team as a whole, rather than just one player.
    - -3 indicates that the participant is a confederate whose identity was not
    recorded.
    - Participants with IDs > 999 are confederates (i.e., experimenters who
    stepped in to replace no-show participants or participants who left partway
    through the group session.)

# Baseline task observation tables

Tables have been added for all the non-physio observations for all the baseline
tasks. The tables added are listed below.

- `affective_task_event`
- `fingertapping_task_observation`
- `ping_pong_competitive_task_observation`
- `ping_pong_cooperative_task_observation`

Note that for the finger tapping and ping pong tasks, the table names end in
`_observation`, since the majority of the rows (with the exception of events
denoting the start of the task) are *state* observations at regular time
intervals, rather than *events*, as in the affective task.

## `fnirs_raw` table updated

- In the previous version of the `fnirs_raw` table, the participant IDs
- The fnirs_raw table is now correctly labeled, and doesn't have labels for
rows in which we do not know for sure which participant was wearing the cap.
- Invalid data removed

## Other changes
- The schema diagram has been updated.
