## List of updates

- [2023-07-19](/updates/2023-07-19): This update adds the following:
    - [Data Products document](http://ivilab.cs.arizona.edu/data/tomcat/data_products.pdf),
    which contains descriptions of both the raw
    data (this is primarily meant for internal documentation purposes) and the
    derived data products (this is meant for public consumption, to aid users
    of the [derived data products](/derived-data-products) in performing their
    analyses).
    - New version of derived data products. The new data process introduces
    substantial changes, both from the user's standpoint and under the hood.
    From the user perspective, the new process includes additional experiments
    and raw channels of fNIRS that were previously excluded. It also integrates
    a comprehensive report on the EEG and fNIRS filtering process, combines the
    entire process report into a single file, offers CSV files with filtered
    and synchronized signals, and removes NaN values in signal columns. Naming
    has been improved with `nirs` replaced by `fnirs`, and the `experiment_id`
    column has been eliminated from CSV files. Internally, the signal
    processing methods for EEG and fNIRS signals have been updated, including
    changes to grouping, interpolation, filtering, and resampling approaches.
    Signals are now synchronized and resampled before task grouping, linear
    interpolation is used for consistent signal intervals before filtering, the
    Butterworth filter order is reduced to 4, the Chebychev type I filter
    replaces the lowpass FIR filter for aliasing avoidance, and a fast Fourier
    transform-based method is used for resampling to target frequency.
- [2023-07-17](/updates/2023-07-17): A major update that adds new data from
baseline tasks, fixes labels in and removes invalid data from the `fnirs_raw`
table, and adds a set of new 'base' tables, foreign key relationships, and
indices to facilitate new queries and speed up existing queries. See
[here](/updates/2023-07-17) for more details.
