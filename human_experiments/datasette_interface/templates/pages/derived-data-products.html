# Derived data products

We provide a number of derived data products based on this dataset.

Documentation for the derived data products is in sections 4 and 5 of the [data
products document](http://ivilab.cs.arizona.edu/data/tomcat/data_products.pdf).

As of 2024-02-22, we recommend using the derived data in the `*_sync` tables in
the SQLite3 database rather than the CSVs in the older derived data releases
listed below, as the 2024-02-22 release fixes a number of issues with the
2023-08-28 version of the derived data (see [here](/updates/2024-02-22) for
details).

## Older versions

We always recommend using the latest version of the derived data products, as
older versions may have issues that are fixed in the newest versions, and the
documentation is only accurate for the newest version.

However, we will continue to provide the older versions for as long as
we feasibly can.
