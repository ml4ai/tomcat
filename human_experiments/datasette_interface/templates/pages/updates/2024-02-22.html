# 2024-02-22 update

## 1. New data

### 1.1 Synchronized physio data tables

Added new tables (`fnirs_sync`, `gsr_sync`, `eeg_sync`, and `ekg_sync`) to the
database to store preprocessed signals synchronized to a main clock for four
modalities (fNIRS, GSR, EEG, and EKG) across experiments, with filtering for
artifact removal. For each experiment, a main clock was defined with start time
at 5 seconds before the beginning of the first task (rest state), end time at 5
seconds after the end of last task (Minecraft), and frequency at 200 Hz.

The changes are introduced in this PR:
https://github.com/ml4ai/tomcat/pull/558.

The pipeline for synchronization that produces the data in the `*_sync` tables
differs from the pipeline described in our [NeurIPS 2023
paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZJWQfgXQb6) (that produced the [derived
data products from
2023-08-28](https://tomcat.ivilab.org/derived-data-products)) in the following
ways:

- In the 2023-08-28 version of the derived data products, we used the same
functions for filtering the GSR and EKG signals as we did for the EEG data.
However, this was an error on our part. We now use the proper GSR and EKG
filtering functions from the [neurokit](https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/)
library.
- In the 2023-08-28 version of the derived data products, we used the earliest
timestamp for the modality among the participants as the starting point.
However, this creates a different start time for each modality, which makes it
challenging if a user wants to work with multiple modalities. So instead, we
defined a shared main clock for each group session which starts 30 seconds
before the first task and ends ends 30 seconds after the final task. All
modalities are now mapped to the ticks in this clock (in the `*_sync` tables in
the database).
- In the 2023-08-28 version of the derived data products, synchronized signals
were generated for 100 Hz, 500 Hz, and 1000 Hz. However, the new `*_sync`
tables in the database only contain synchronized signals at 200 Hz, based on
recent discussions with experts on brain data processing (100 Hz may lose
important information, and 500/1000 Hz is excessive computationally expensive).

### 1.2 Vocalic features table

Added a table called `audio_vocalics` that contains vocalic features extracted
using [OpenSMILE](https://github.com/audeering/opensmile/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

### 1.3 Updated `fnirs_raw` table

Expanded fNIRS data by adding raw signals for 760 nm and 850 nm wavelengths to
the `fnirs_raw` table, in case users wish to transform those into HbO and HbR
themselves.

### 1.4 Added advisor information

Added a column to the `group_session` table containing information about which
advisor was present during the trials.

## 2. Timestamp corrections

### 2.1 Timestamp corrections for exp_2023_01_31_14

**Summary**: Corrected Minecraft start/end timestamps for exp_2023_01_31_14
which had inconsistent dates in the future.

**Explanation**: `exp_2023_01_31_14` had dates for trial start/stop and mission
stop (same as trial stop due to the absence of a mission stop message in the
corresponding `.metadata` file) in the past due to inconsistency.  We noticed
that the code was not taking the most recent trial dates into consideration in
case of multiple trial start/stop.  We fixed the data processing code and
updated the dates manually.  The wrong dates were causing the main clock not to
have any ticks because rest state (with correct timestamp) had timestamp after
the Minecraft task which is used to compute the final timestamp of the main
clock when synchronizing signals.

### 2.2 Timestamps for rest state task in exp_2022_12_05_12.

**Summary**: Added start and end timestamps for the rest state task in
`exp_2022_12_05_12`.

**Explanation**: If there are no start and end timestamps saved in the raw data
file for the rest state task (prior to 2023-04, the timestamps for the rest
state task were being saved in a CSV file), we use the file modification date
as an approximation to the start timestamp when it started and add 300 seconds
to the start timestamp to obtain the end timestamp. The file is created when
the task start so the offset should be minimal. So far, only experiment
`exp_2022_12_05_12` has this issue. We use the start time of the rest state
when defining the main clock, so having that information is important for us
not to lose any data.

## 3. Fixed swapped signals for EKG and GSR for some experiments.

Addressed an issue where EKG and GSR signals were swapped in specific
experiments:

- `exp_2022_09_30_10`
- `exp_2022_10_04_09` for the `lion` station
- `exp_2022_10_04_09` for the `tiger` station) by updating the raw EEG data
processing processing to swap the signals for these specific instances.
