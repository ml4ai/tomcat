# 2023-07-17 update

This is a major update that implements the following changes.

## Base tables

A number of 'base tables' have been added in order to facilitate querying, as
well as provide additional layers of validation while constructing the
database. The tables that have been added are the following:

- `data_validity`: This table contains information about
                   which participants were involved in the tasks, and whether
                   the data from the EEG,
                   fNIRS, and eye tracking modalities are valid. In most
                   cases, when an experimenter stepped in to replace a
                   participant (e.g., for a now-show participant), they did
                   not wear fNIRS/EEG devices, and in some cases, they did not
                   wear the eye tracker either. Not all groups completed all
                   the tasks, and for some tasks, the data is missing. In
                   cases such as these, the table simply omits rows for which
                   we do not have data.
- `modality`: The modality of a physiological observation (currently contains
information about EEG/fNIRS/eye tracking, other modalities (e.g., EKG) to be
added soon.)
- `task`: The task being performed.
- `station`: The ID of the iMac that the participant was seated at while
performing a task. As it turns out, this information is critical for sorting
out participant IDs in cases when an experimenter steps in to take the place
of a participant, or in some cases, when participants are moved from one
station to another due to equipment issues. It is also a potentially useful
field to have for other types of queries.

### Other changes:

#### `participant` table

- The `is_confederate` column has been removed from the `participant` table,
for two reasons:
  - The datatype of the `participant.id` column is now `INTEGER`.
  - The Datasette interface was displaying the value of the `is_confederate`
  column in links arising from foreign key relationships, instead of the actual
  value of the participant ID.
  - We now have additional participant IDs to denote special circumstances:
    - -1 indicates an unknown participant.
    - -2 indicates the team as a whole. This is relevant for the
    affective_task_event table, where some events intrinsically involve the
    team as a whole, rather than just one player.
    - -3 indicates that the participant is a confederate whose identity was not
    recorded.
    - Participants with IDs > 999 are confederates (i.e., experimenters who
    stepped in to replace no-show participants or participants who left partway
    through the group session.)

# Baseline task observation tables

Tables have been added for all the non-physio observations for all the baseline
tasks. The tables added are listed below.

- `affective_task_event`
- `fingertapping_task_observation`
- `ping_pong_competitive_task_observation`
- `ping_pong_cooperative_task_observation`

Note that for the finger tapping and ping pong tasks, the table names end in
`_observation`, since the majority of the rows (with the exception of events
denoting the start of the task) are *state* observations at regular time
intervals, rather than *events*, as in the affective task.

## `fnirs_raw` table updated

The new version of the `fnirs_raw` table fixes the following errors.

- For some of the group sessions, an experimenter stepped in to replace a
participant mid-way through the session, however, the `participant` column was
set to the experimenter's ID for all the rows in that group session, rather
than only the ones in which the experimenter stepped in. The new version uses
the `data_validity` table to assign the correct participant IDs for each task.
- The tasks are 'atomic' in the sense that if a participant decided to leave
the group session in the middle of a task and an experimenter filled in for
them, the task would be restarted. Thus, for a given task in a group session,
the value of the `participant` column in the `fnirs_raw` table should not
change. However, for the rows corresponding to the time in between tasks, it is
not known for certain whether (i) the EEG/fNIRS cap was being worn by a
participant (confederate or otherwise) and (ii) if the cap was being work by a
participant, what the ID of that participant is.  This is because it was not
feasible for us to record the timestamps corresponding to a participant taking
off their fNIRS cap (which is inherently a temporally extended event) with a
high level of temporal precision. Thus, for the rows in the table corresponding
to the time in between tasks, we assign a participant ID of `-1`, indicating an
unknown (as of now) participant. In a future update, we will do a bit more inference to
label these 'inter-task' rows. That is, if the participant ID does not change
between tasks, we will likely label the rows for the period between those tasks
with that participant ID. We expect that users of this data will likely be more
immediately interested in the fNIRS signals that occur during tasks.
- In most cases, when an experimenter steps in for a participant, they do not
wear the fNIRS/EEG cap, since setting up the cap properly on a participant's
head is a lengthy process. The cap still records values for the rest of the
duration of the group session after it has been removed from the participant's
head, but in most cases (i.e., whenever the confederate is not wearing the
cap), these values are simply noise and can be safely ignored.s validity
information is captured in the `data_validity` table. Thus, we delete rows in
the `fnirs_raw` table for which the data is not valid (i.e., the `is_valid`
column in the `data_validity` table equals 0).

## Other changes
- The database schema diagram has been updated.
- Additional metadata has been added in the form of descriptions for the
various tables and columns.
