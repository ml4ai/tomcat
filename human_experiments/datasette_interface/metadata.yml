                    Table with information about which participants were
                    involved in the tasks, and whether the data from the EEG,
                    fNIRS, and eye tracking modalities are valid. In most
                    cases, when an experimenter stepped in to replace a
                    participant (e.g., for a no-show participant), they did
                    not wear fNIRS/EEG devices, and in some cases, they did not
                    wear the eye tracker either. Not all groups completed all
                    the tasks, and for some tasks, the data is missing. In
                    cases such as these, the table simply omits rows for which
