            affective_task_event:
                description: Events from the individual and team affective tasks.
                columns:
                    group_session: The group session the task is a part of.
                    participant: Participant ID.
                    timestamp_unix: The Unix timestamp of the event.
                    timestamp_iso8601: The ISO-8601 timestamp of the event.
                    event_type: The type of the event.
                    image_path: The path to the image that was shown on the participant screen(s).
                    arousal_score: The arousal score reported by the participant. Null if not applicable.
                    valence_score: The valence score reported by the participant. Null if not applicable.

            data_validity:
                description: >
                    Table with information about which participants were
                    involved in the tasks, and whether the data from the EEG,
                    fNIRS, and eye tracking modalities are valid. In most
                    cases, when an experimenter stepped in to replace a
                    participant (e.g., for a no-show participant), they did
                    not wear fNIRS/EEG devices, and in some cases, they did not
                    wear the eye tracker either. Not all groups completed all
                    the tasks, and for some tasks, the data is missing. In
                    cases such as these, the table simply omits rows for which
                    we do not have data.
                columns:
                    group_session: Group session ID
                    participant: Participant ID
                    station: The iMac that the participant was stationed at.
                    task: Task ID.
                    modality: The modality of the data.
                    is_valid: >
                        Whether the data for the relevant
                        participant/task/modality is valid (1) or invalid (0).


            fnirs_raw:
                description: >
                    Table with raw fNIRS data.
                columns:
                    group_session: Group session ID
                    task: Task ID.
                    station: The iMac that the participant was stationed at.
                    participant: >
                        Participant ID. A participant ID of -1 indicates an
                        unknown participant. All rows that do not have values
                        for the `task` column will have their participant ID
                        set to -1. In the future, we will label some of these
                        inter/pre/post task rows with the correct participant
                        ID.
                    timestamp_unix: The Unix timestamp of the event.
                    timestamp_iso8601: The ISO-8601 timestamp of the event.

            group_session:
                description: Table with group session IDs.
                columns:
                    id: >
                        Group session ID. Format: `exp_YYYY_MM_DD_HH`.

            mission:
                description: Metadata about the Minecraft missions.
                columns:
                    id: The unique ID of the mission.

                    start_timestamp_iso8601: The starting timestamp of the mission in ISO-8601 format.
                    start_timestamp_unix: The starting Unix timestamp of the mission.
                    stop_timestamp_iso8601: The stop timestamp of the mission in ISO-8601 format.

                    final_team_score: The final mission score achieved by the team.
                    testbed_version: The version of the testbed used for the mission.

            modality:
                description: Modalities for physiological data.
                columns:
                    id: The ID of the modality.

            participant:

                columns:
                    id: >
                        Participant ID.
                        -1 indicates an unknown participant.
                        -2 indicates the team as a whole. This is relevant for the affective_task_event table,
                        where some events intrinsically involve the team as a whole, rather than just one player.
                        -3 indicates that the participant is a confederate whose identity was not recorded.
                        Participants with IDs > 999 are confederates (i.e.,
                        experimenters who stepped in to replace no-show
                        participants or participants who left partway through
                        the group session.)

                description: Observations from the competitive ping-pong tasks.

                      The contents of the message. The messages are in JSON
                      format, so you can leverage SQLite JSON functions and operators
