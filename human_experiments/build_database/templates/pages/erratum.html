<p>Welcome to the ToMCAT dataset!
The dataset currently is served via one SQLite database, but we may add
additional ones in the future. <p>

<p> Currently, there are tables for the participant information, group session,
raw fNIRS data, the testbed messages, the affective task, rest state task. More
tables will be added in the future.</p>

<p>For users who are not familiar with SQL,  we will provide some sample SQL
queries to demonstrate how to use this database and the associated Datasette
interface.</p>

<p>For more advanced users, feel free to try different queries, use the
programmatic APIs provided by Datasette, or simply download the whole SQLite
database (see the link at the bottom of the https://tomcat.ivilab.org/tomcat
page.)</p>
