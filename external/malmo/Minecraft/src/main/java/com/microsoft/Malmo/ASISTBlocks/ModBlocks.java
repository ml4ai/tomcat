 * extends Block (directly or indirectly) which defines your new Block type 2)
 * Instantiate this block in the init() method below 3) Copy paste the code in
 * the indicated methods and change the instance name in the copied lines to
 * your new block name. <p> Note: you must register the block both as a Block
 * AND as an Item so Minecraft knows that you can hold it in your inventory
 * before placing it into the world.
 * <p>
 * The registration methods used here are called in the MalmoMod PreInit() and
 * MalmoModClient init() methods. Nothing needs to be modified there. <p>
 * Remember to add a line to the en_US.lang file in
